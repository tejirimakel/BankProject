For example, we make loans to finance the acquisition and renovation of real estate, to businesses and non-profits who want to purchase their own building or expand into more real estate. We also make non-real estate secured loans to small businesses for equipment, business expansion, or receivables-based lines of credit.  We do not currently make consumer loans.</p>
